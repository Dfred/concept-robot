Abstract:
=========

This software is part of the CONCEPT project from the University of Plymouth,
 under supervision of Dr tony Belpaeme.

The team involves :
- frederic Delaunay, human-robot interaction
- joachim De Greeff, conceptual modeling

The project is part of frederic Delaunay's PhD, under supervision of
 Dr Tony Belpaeme.
This PhD is expected to end in late 2011.
In the meantime, you are welcomed to try the software and submit bugfixes.

Requirements (In this order):
=============

- python 2.6 or 2.7
- blender 2.49b
- for Windows:
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package x86 (if you use blender
 backend)
* readline (if you want to use the readline client,
 http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/download.cgi/Readline-1.7.win32-py2.6.exe)


Running the software:
=====================

Windows:
-------
Try to achieve step 2.2 using blender. File to load is in HRI/face/blender/ .
Then run start_face.bat, if it fails because you have non-default installation,
 check the file and edit the paths.
If it still fails, you'll have to make sure each dependency works using the
 command line (cmd.exe) ...


Open people would just:
----------------------

1) Open a shell and change into the directory containing this file.

2) Create a blender executable (To be done once and for all):

  2.1) you can load environment variables (supposedly for development):

       $ . common/source_me_to_set_env.sh  lightHead

	or using bash:
       $ source common/source_me_to_set_env.sh  lightHead

       lightHead is the project name, setting the search for a system
        configuration file to lightHead.conf.
       This also allows multiple variations of a configuration.

  2.2) open the blend file to generate a standalone version for your platform:

       $ edit_face

       Use blender menu: File > Save Game as Runtime, and save it in this folder
        as: "lightHead"

3) start the facial animation system with:
 
   $ ./start_face.sh

   By default the graphical interface is in full-screen;
    use option -w to enjoy window mode.


Now you can connect and start setting Action Units according to the protocol
 definition. Rather you could use the expression datablock specification for
 higher-level animation.
