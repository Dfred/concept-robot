Abstract:
=========

This software is part of the CONCEPT project from the University of Plymouth,
 under supervision of Dr tony Belpaeme.

The team involves :
- frederic Delaunay, human-robot interaction
- joachim De Greeff, conceptual modeling

The project is part of frederic Delaunay's PhD, under supervision of
 Dr Tony Belpaeme.
This PhD is expected to end in late 2011.
In the meantime, you are welcomed to try the software and submit bugfixes.

Requirements (In this order):
=============

- python 2.6
- blender 2.49b
- for Windows:
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package x86
* readline (if you want to use the readline client,
 http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/download.cgi/Readline-1.7.win32-py2.6.exe)


Running the software:
=====================

Windows:
-------
Try to achieve step 2.2 using blender. File to load is in HRI/face/blender/.
Then run start.bat. If it fails, backtrack in the terminal window to check the
 first error message. You may need to edit your configuration file.


Open source people would:
------------------------

1) Open a shell and change into the directory containing this file.

2) Create a blender executable (To be done once and for all):

  2.1) you can load environment variables (supposedly for development):

       $ . common/source_me_to_set_env.sh  lightHead

	or using bash:
       $ source common/source_me_to_set_env.sh  lightHead

       lightHead is the project name, setting the search for a system
        configuration file to lightHead.conf.
       This also allows multiple variations of a configuration.

  2.2) open the blend file to generate a standalone version for your platform:

       $ edit_face        (if you have followed 2.1)

       Use blender menu: File > Save Game as Runtime, and save it in this folder
        as: "lightHead"

3) start the facial animation system with:

   $ ./start.sh

   By default the graphical interface is in full-screen;
    use option -w to enjoy window mode.


Now you can connect and start setting Action Units according to the protocol
 definition. Rather, you could use the Expression server along with its
 datablock specification for higher-level animation.
