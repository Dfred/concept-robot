Requirements (In this order):
=============

- python 2.6
- blender 2.49b
- for Windows, readline (if you want to use the readline client, http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/download.cgi/Readline-1.7.win32-py2.6.exe)


Running the software:
=====================

Windows:
-------
Try to achieve step 2.2 using blender. File to load is in HRI/face/blender/ .
Then run start_face.bat


Open people would just:
----------------------

1) Open a shell and change into the directory containing this file.

2) Setting environment variables...

  2.1) you can load environment variables (supposedly for development):

       $ ./source_me_to_set_env.sh

  2.2) open the blend file to generate a standalone version for your platform:

       $ edit_face

       Use blender menu: File > Save Game as Runtime, and save it as: "lightHead"

3) start the facial animation system with:
 
   $ ./start_face.sh
