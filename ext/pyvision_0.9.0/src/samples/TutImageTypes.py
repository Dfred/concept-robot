# Unlike many other graphics libraries PyVision does not have its own native
# pixel format.  Instead it depends on other libraries to implement this array
# data, and PyVision acts as a translator.  PyVision therefore provides a
# common framework that allows PIL, SciPy and OpenCV to work together to
# solve problems.

# This tutorial looks at pv.Image as a way to convert between types used
# in the PyVision library.  pv.Images are used as a common format that can
# easily translate between PIL, Numpy, and OpenCV formats.  Under the hood
# a pv.Image is represented by one of these formats, and the image is 
# converted to new formats on demand. 

# pv.Image implements a number of translation methods that allows images to
# be obtained in many useful formats.  These methods are:
# * asMatrix2D() -> gray scale (one-channel) SciPy array
# * asMatrix3D() -> color (three-channel) SciPy array
# * asPIL() -> Python Imageing Library (PIL) image
# * asOpenCV() -> OpenCV Color Image (8-bit)
# * asOpenCVBW() -> OpenCV gray scale (Black/White) Image (8-bit)
# * asAnnotated() -> A PIL formated image which includes annotations made to this image.
# 
# The constructor for pv.Images can also take any of these formats as 
# arguments.  Therefore converting between types can be done by code such as:
# OPENCV_IMAGE = pv.Image(NUMPY_MATIRX).asOpenCV()

# In this tutorial we will demonstraite how to use pv.Image to convert images
# to different formates and in each format we will perform a simple image 
# processing task of thresholding an image to produce a black and white 
# equivalent.

    # Image logs are used to save images and other data to a directory
    # for later analysis.  These logs are valuable tools for understanding
    # the imagery and debugging algorithms.  Unless otherwise specified, 
    # ImageLogs are usually created in the directory "/tmp".
    ilog = pv.ImageLog()

    # and help determine runtimes and can determine which parts of algorithms

    im = pv.Image(filename)
    
    # This command saves the image to an image log which provides good 
    # information for debugging.  It is often helpful to save many images

    # intended result.

    # be slower than OpenCV and also lacks many of the more specialized
    # computer vision algorithms.

    # "asMatrix2D" returns the 2D array containing the gray scale pixel
    # values. The values in the matrix are indexed using standard pixel
    # mat[x,y] coordinates and mat.shape = (w,h).  This may be transposed
    # from what some people might expect.  Matricies are typically indexed 
    # using "rows" and "columns" so the matrix has been transposed to 
    # maintain the image-like x,y indexing.  There is also a method
    # called asMatrix3D() which returns color data in a 3D array.
    
    # A pv.Image will often maintain multiple representations of an image.
    # Calling a method like asMatrix2D will generate and return a Scipy format
    # copy of the image.  That copy will also be cached for future use so
    # multiple calls to asMatrix2D will only generate that image for the 
    # first call, and all subsequent calls will return the cached copy.
