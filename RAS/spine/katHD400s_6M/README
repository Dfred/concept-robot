Katana Arm Backend, INSTRUCTIONS:

To build the custom KNI wrapper and use this python module, you need:
1) to have successfully built the KatanaNativeInterface SDK.
2) to use the Makefile in this directory. 
Note: you'd need to define KNI_SDK_DIR environment variable for the build.
You can do this:

$ KNI_SDK_DIR=~/user/opt/KNI make

This would build libLH_KNI_wrapper.so without debug nor optimization.
Also, the Makefile provides 3 rules (debug, all, optim) you can specify to make.

3) to copy the configuration file (from $KNI_SDK_DIR/configfiles4*/) that
 matches your katana arm version.

It is not yet clear if the KNI license allows distributing these files.
